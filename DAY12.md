# Day 12: Project Management and Multi-Team Collaboration

## Objective
Develop advanced project management skills, focusing on Agile, risk management, and stakeholder engagement.

## Key Concepts
- __Agile Methodology:__ Iterative development with sprints and stand-ups.
- __Risk Register:__ Identifies, assesses, and mitigates project risks.
- __Resource Allocation:__ Optimizes team assignments for efficiency.

## Mathematical Formulation
Risk Score:

$$
R = P \cdot I
$$

Where:

- $P$ : Probability of risk occurrence
- $I$ : Impact of risk

```

## Business Context
- __Efficiency:__ Agile practices accelerate development and adaptation.
- __Risk Mitigation:__ Proactive management reduces project failures.
- __Collaboration:__ Engages all teams, ensuring alignment and success.
