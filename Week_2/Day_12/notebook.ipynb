        "Upgrade the margin methodology to support Equities, Credit, and Commodities, optimizing capital efficiency while ensuring regulatory compliance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Scope\n",
        "Develop a multi-asset margin allocation model incorporating cross-margining, using Python with Mosek for optimization. The model will compute VaR-based margins and provide attribution for transparency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Stakeholders\n",
        "- **Portfolio Managers**: Need low margins to maximize returns.\n",
        "- **Risk Team**: Require VaR ≤ 5% (95% confidence) and FINRA compliance.\n",
        "- **IT**: Provide data pipelines (CSV format) and deploy model.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Milestones\n",
        "1. **Week 1: Data Collection**\n",
        "   - Task: IT to provide 1 year of daily returns for 10 assets.\n",
        "   - Duration: 5 days.\n",
        "2. **Week 2: Prototype Development**\n",
        "   - Task: Build model with Mosek, test on sample data.\n",
        "   - Duration: 5 days.\n",
        "3. **Week 3: Testing and Validation**\n",
        "   - Task: Validate VaR and margins with Risk Team.\n",
        "   - Duration: 5 days.\n",
        "4. **Week 4: Deployment**\n",
        "   - Task: IT to integrate model into production.\n",
        "   - Duration: 5 days.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Dependencies\n",
        "- IT: Deliver data by Week 1.\n",
        "- Risk Team: Approve VaR thresholds by Week 2.\n",
        "- PMs: Provide asset weights by Week 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Risks\n",
        "- **Data Quality (Probability: 0.3, Impact: High)**: Incomplete returns data.\n",
        "  - Mitigation: Implement data validation scripts.\n",
        "- **Regulatory Changes (Probability: 0.2, Impact: Medium)**: New FINRA rules.\n",
        "  - Mitigation: Use modular code for quick updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Resources\n",
        "- Team: 1 Quant Researcher, 1 IT Developer, 1 Risk Analyst.\n",
        "- Tools: Python, Mosek, Jira for tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Timeline\n",
        "- Total Duration: 4 weeks (20 working days).\n",
        "- Critical Path: Data Collection → Prototype → Testing → Deployment."
