# Project Plan: Margin Methodology Upgrade

## Objective
Upgrade the margin methodology to support Equities, Credit, and Commodities, optimizing capital efficiency while ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Scope
Develop a multi-asset margin allocation model incorporating cross-margining, using Python with Mosek for optimization. The model will compute VaR-based margins and provide attribution for transparency.

## Stakeholders
- **Portfolio Managers**: Need low margins to maximize returns.
- **Risk Team**: Require VaR ≤ 5% (95% confidence) and FINRA compliance.
- **IT**: Provide data pipelines (CSV format) and deploy model.

## Milestones
1. **Week 1: Data Collection**
   - Task: IT to provide 1 year of daily returns for 10 assets.
   - Duration: 5 days.
2. **Week 2: Prototype Development**
   - Task: Build model with Mosek, test on sample data.
   - Duration: 5 days.
3. **Week 3: Testing and Validation**
   - Task: Validate VaR and margins with Risk Team.
   - Duration: 5 days.
4. **Week 4: Deployment**
   - Task: IT to integrate model into production.
   - Duration: 5 days.

## Dependencies
- IT: Deliver data by Week 1.
- Risk Team: Approve VaR thresholds by Week 2.
- PMs: Provide asset weights by Week 2.

## Risks
- **Data Quality (Probability: 0.3, Impact: High)**: Incomplete returns data.
  - Mitigation: Implement data validation scripts.
- **Regulatory Changes (Probability: 0.2, Impact: Medium)**: New FINRA rules.
  - Mitigation: Use modular code for quick updates.

## Resources
- Team: 1 Quant Researcher, 1 IT Developer, 1 Risk Analyst.
- Tools: Python, Mosek, Jira for tracking.

## Timeline
- Total Duration: 4 weeks (20 working days).
- Critical Path: Data Collection → Prototype → Testing → Deployment.
