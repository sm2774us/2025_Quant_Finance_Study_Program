# Day 6: Collaboration and Business Context

## Objective
Develop advanced stakeholder management and requirements engineering skills for quant model development.

## Key Concepts
- __User Stories:__ Capture stakeholder needs in a structured format.
- __Prioritization Matrix:__ Balance business value, risk mitigation, and effort.
- __Communication Plans:__ Tailor messaging to different stakeholder groups.

## Mathematical Formulation
- __Expected Value for Prioritization:__

$$
EV = \sum_{i} p_i v_i
$$4

Where:

- $p_i$ : Probability of success for feature $i )
- $v_i$ : Business value of feature $i )

```

## Business Context
- __Alignment:__ Ensures quant models meet business needs and regulatory requirements.
- __Efficiency:__ Prioritization focuses resources on high-impact features.
- __Adoption:__ Clear communication increases stakeholder buy-in and model usage.
